bio: My name is Kaixing ZHAO, born on 18/01/1995 in China. I am a Ph.D. Candidate of Elipse team, IRIT (CNRS UMR 5505, Toulouse Institute of Computer Science Research, France) and University of Toulouse (Toulouse 3 - Paul Sabatier University). I work both with researchers of CNRS (French National Science Research Center) and professors of Paul Sabatier University and my research is dedicated to designing novel interaction techniques in the field of ubiquitous computing, cognitive science and visually impaired augmented technologies. I am also interested in some artificial intelligence technologies. My supervisors are Dr. Christophe Jouffrais (Senior Research Scientist in Cognitive Science, CNRS, Director of IPAL Lab of CNRS/National University of Singapore/Sorbonne University) and Dr. Marcos Serrano (Associate Professor in Computer Science, University of Toulouse).
